When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others or when you may be using different computers.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks copy someone elses code within github, clones copy code from a remote repository to your computer, branches allow you to split your code so you can have multiple versions
being worked on at the same time.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows you to work locally while others make changes, which you can then merge back in later.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Sharing a common folder on your local network. No version control or streamlined system for integrating changes. It would easier
to deal with local people and probably require less complicated commands to make changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Experimental changes are good to put in a separate branch so that you can test ideas without affecting the main body of code. Separate
branches also help when collaborating with others since 'master' is typically viewed as the stable, unchanging base which
everything else is built off of.
